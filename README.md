# Fiverr Marketplace: Strategic Pricing Patterns by Gig Category
## Problem
Beginner freelancers on Fiverr often struggle with two key uncertainties: what kind of gigs to offer and how much to charge. Without a clear understanding of market expectations, it's easy to underprice services or enter an overcrowded niche. This analysis focuses on the data analytics service category and aims to provide practical guidance for new sellers.

## Strategic Question
What pricing tiers dominate each Fiverr gig subcategory within data analytics, and what does that imply about competition and revenue potential?

## Objectives
Identify the major subcategories within the Fiverr data analytics market
Analyze typical pricing behavior—such as averages, medians, and price ranges—for each
The goal is to help beginners understand what types of gigs are in demand and how to position themselves competitively based on actual pricing data.

## Scope & Limitations
For the purpose of this project, the scope will be narrowed to focus primarily on identifying the types of services (“products”) being offered within the Fiverr data analytics market. While it’s understood that each seller or gig may offer multiple overlapping services, this project will not attempt to build a fully accurate one-to-many mapping between sellers and service categories due to the complexity involved. Such a task would require advanced natural language processing techniques and possibly labeled data for supervised learning. Instead, this analysis will use simplified, exploratory methods (e.g., keyword extraction, clustering) to uncover the main types of offerings in the market. More robust modeling of multi-label service classification and performance correlation would be suitable for a future extension or if deployed in a commercial context.
